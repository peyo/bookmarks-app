# Bookmarks React Client
_This project is a demonstration for Thinkful's React course_

This app was created to exercise for the concepts of Route, Link, and History.

With Route, users can navigate directly to components without having to manually update states.
With Link, page load times are reduced thus improving usability and user experience.
With History, users are directed back to previous a page after an action is taken, such as clicking a button.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
